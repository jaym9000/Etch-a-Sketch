This Etch-a-Sketch project allows you to draw on a grid with different colors by hovering over the page with your mouse.
Feel free to show your talents on the sketch pad!

Some of my challenges:

The project looked easy at first, but came with many challenges. Creating a grid that can change size with out taking up more screen pixels was a challenge at first. Another challenge I came along was adding a RGB color changer.

After a lot of reading and researching I got through these challenges!

I plan to make this mobile friendly when I revisit, but for now it only works on a laptop/Desktop Device with mouse.
